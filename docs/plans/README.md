# Plans

Dated execution plans. Product, architecture, interaction, and data-model facts stay in the durable docs tree; files here only say how to land, in what order, and what to verify.

Layout: `YYYY/MM-DD/<lane>-<slug>.md`, with a derived `w<wave>-` prefix once the plan joins the dependency graph. `<lane>` is the plan's permanent mint order within its day, assigned by the skill script and never recomputed. Mint files with the `plan-docs` skill script; do not invent paths. Todos use `- [ ]` / `- [x]` / `- [-]`; scan and print sections with `scripts/todos.py`. Cross-plan order comes from each plan's frontmatter `depends_on`; waves are computed per day (every day starts at wave 0) and the Wave table below is derived by `scripts/plan-index.py` — run the script, never hand-edit that block.
